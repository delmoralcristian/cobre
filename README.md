### Improvements ###

Due to the limited time available to implement the project, 
I focused on delivering a working end-to-end solution that covered the core functionality. 
However, there are several important areas that can still be improved to enhance robustness, 
maintainability, and reliability:

* Add lock to prevent duplicate processing. eventId-clientId
* Use DLQ to enqueue messages that fail to process
* Add ControllerAdvice to handle exceptions like:
  * EntityNotFoundException.class - NOT_FOUND
  * IllegalArgumentException.class - BAD_REQUEST
* Add unit tests and integration tests
